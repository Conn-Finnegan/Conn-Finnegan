## 🚀 What I Do

I build AI tools that are lightweight, transparent, and production-ready — from core model development to full-stack deployment. My focus areas:

- 🧠 **Computer Vision** – diagnostic tools for skin and breast cancer
- 🔍 **RAG & LLMs** – building secure, domain-aware retrieval systems
- ⚙️ **AI Infrastructure** – cloud deployment, API integration, Core ML/Edge
- 🎮 **Game Engines** – low-level systems with C++/OpenGL

## 🧪 Flagship Projects

### 🔬 Soma – Skin Cancer Classifier  
A ResNet-based tool for skin lesion classification (~89% accuracy), enhanced with Grad-CAM for transparency and deployed across web/mobile via Core ML.

### 🧠 Lumen – Breast Cancer Detection  
A real-time CNN system for classifying histopathology slides, optimised for clinical environments where speed, interpretability, and accuracy are critical.
